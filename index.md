In a recent project I wanted to use the drought index *Standardised Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index* ([*SPEI*](http://spei.csic.es/)). The website of the indicator offers rich information and gives you two options to download SPEI data: either by single location or get an netCDF file.

This got me started to explore the file format netCDF and the R package *ncdf4*. The post by Bartlein P. J. ([R for Earth-System Science](http://geog.uoregon.edu/bartlein/courses/geog490/week04-netCDF.html) helped me initially a lot and is foundation for some of the functions I present here. 

In the process of working on the SPEI data (extracting data frames from the netCDF files and adjusting and visualizing the data) I decided to share my code. To make the re-use as easy as possible I ended up creating a package, getSpei, on github and I demonstrate on this website the use of the package and visualization of the data generated with it. I hope it helps!
