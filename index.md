For a project I wanted to use the drought index [SPEI](https://spei.csic.es/), as you have either the option to download each of your location one by one or get an netCDF file I started to explore the file format netCDF and the R package 'ncdf4'. The post by Bartlein P. J. ([R for Earth-System Science](http://geog.uoregon.edu/bartlein/courses/geog490/week04-netCDF.html) helped me a lot in the beginning and are base for some of the functions I present here. I reflected while working on extracting data frames from the netCDF file and adjusting and visualizing the data that quite some time of researchers a spend on tasks others did before. Therefore, I decided to create my own package, getSpei, on github and to illustrate it.
